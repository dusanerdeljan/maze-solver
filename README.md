## Supported algorithms

### Maze generation algorithms

Maze generation algorithms are based on finding the minimum spanning tree of a grid-like graph with random edge weights.<br/>
Supported maze generation algorithms:
 * Kruskal
 * Prim-Jarnik
 * Boruvka

### Maze solving algorithms

Currently supported maze solving algorithms are the most popular pathfinding algorithms:
 * Depth-first search (DFS)
 * Breadth-first search (BFS)
 * Dijkstra
 * A* with Manhattan distance as heuristic function

## Controls

`Click` on the board to place the start vertex.<br/>
`Shift` + `Click` on the board to place the end vertex.
